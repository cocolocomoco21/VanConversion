## Overview
The electrical system of the van is by far the most complex and time consuming. It is the underpinnning for enabling capabilities that seem merely aspirational. Who would, upon first seeing a completely empty and hollow cargo van, think "yep, it's definitely possible" to have a full light system, temperature control, refrigerator, water system, and plumbing? Even more, let's make it fully off-the-grid and self sufficient, so that you can have these capabilities without relying on plugging in and entirely self-contained within the van's walls? That magic is what the hard work of the electrical system enables.

For the next posts, I will be starting a series outlining my entire electrical system. This will cover the full process: from defining what I want my electrical system to capable of, the components to get there, their layout, design and install, and everything in between. I'll walk through my electrical diagram, what each main component is and why I chose it, how I physically installed them, and much more. I'm excited for this knowledge sharing and hope you apprecaite the information!

To start this process, I had very little electrical-specific experience. When seeing me working on the van, people always ask "you built this van yourself, did you have prior experience?" I always answer "sort of." Growing up, I would work around the house with my dad on DIY projects. I took wood shop in high school and like working with my hands. I actively participated in robotics in high school and college, but only have transient knowledge of electrical (I did some mechanical and mostly software). However, I've always loved engineering, designing, and building. I have general aptitude, but very little expertise in any one specific area.

 All of this to say, the electrical system and these posts represent my learned and shared knowledge. I couldn't fall back to any one person's expert experience in van electrical systems. I was able to accomplish everything with the joined help of many people, so thank you very much to those who helped along the way. I wouldn't have been able to do it (safely, at least) without the oversight of some more knowledgeable folks :).
