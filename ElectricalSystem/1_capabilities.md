# 1. Capabilities

### Background
The first step in completing an electrical system is understanding what you're trying to get out of it. For me, this is a reasonably straightforward answer: I wanted to be able to live, work, and play out of the van and be able to be self-sufficient for up to ~3 days without a charge.

Let's look at what these mean. "Living" for me means being comfortable in moderation. For example, lights are required, but running water is a nice-to-have. I needed heat for winter and a fan for summer. A fridge could be nice compared to a cooler with ice. A van is a weird line between a home and camping, and refining these comfort vs. camping requirements for your own case naturally leads to a list of ideal vs. real capabilities, which helps create a capabilities list for your van.

"Working" means working as a software engineer remotely, potentially for an afternoon or for a month. I need to charge up to two laptops, two phones, a hotspot, for 8+ hours a day. Pretty straightforward.

"Play" means I want to get out and do things! I may be with or without service. It may be 100 degrees or -20, with incessant or non-existent sun. I want to climb, ski, bike, and hike wherever, and handle nearly anything I throw at myself.

By asking yourself what you want, as I did, you determine your worst-case requirements. In my worst case, I would be somewhere with no sun (spoilers, I have solar panels to charge ;) ) and still post up and function without having to leave. An example would be winter skiing and working. If it were to by cloudy (and ideally snowing!) for three days and therefore providing no solar charge, but I was skiing + working, I'd still need to plan for multiple device charging for three days, heat for three days, refrigeration, lights, running water, etc.

After assessing your needs, you can develop a capabilities list and determine how to accomplish your goals from there!

### Approach
There are many ways to realize your capabilities, but they largely break down on the fundamental structure of an electrical system: charge sources, storage, and loads.

Fundamentally, the center of the system is the storage. You hold all of the energy that you consume. If that storage goes to 0%, you have no power! Oh no. This is the purpose for batteries. There are some different battery approaches, which I'll touch on in a later post.

Charge sources, well, charge the batteries. This can be accomplished through various means. Solar panels are common in van communities, but you can also charge off the alternator while you drive the car, from AC power like RVs, or from a hamster ball (rarely seen in vans).

Loads are the fun part! They are the components which use the energy you work to store. For example, heater/fan, fridge, lights, water pump, antenna, any AC  loads you'd use at home, phones, battery monitors, inverters, etc. They also take a lot of upfront work to design your system around, because knowing your max potential load draw determines your battery capacity, which determines your charge sources.
